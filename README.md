# My dotfiles

Just a bunch of configuration files and scripts to install them on my `~/`, so I can feel home on every computer.

## Inspiration

Main idea and some scritps were taken from [@holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). Thanks!

## Organization

Files are grouped in "topics" (e.g. git, javascript, zsh etc). Each topic contains the respective configuration files.

What `bootstrap.sh` does:

* Creates a symbolic link of every `*.ln` file to `~/` (removing the .ln extension).
* ... that's it (for now)
